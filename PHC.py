##############################################################
# The following assumptions should be satisfied before using this module
# 1. The feature dataset must be cleaned. 
# 2. The datapoints are expected to be at least 2-dimensional vector.
# 3. The dimension of all data points should be consistent, i.e. dim(a) = dim(b) for all a,b in the dataset.
# 4. The classes should be represented by positive integers.
# 5. The data type of the dataset must be pandas dataframe
# 6. On predict function, the data point should have the same dimension as the training data
# 7. The predictee should be a numpy array
